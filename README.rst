#########################################################################

BLEMystique is an ESP32 based custom BLE target which can be configured by the user to behave like one of the multiple BLE devices. BLEMystique allows a pentester to play with the BLE side of different kind of smart devices with a single piece of affordable ESP32 chip. BLEMystique contains multiple device profiles, for example, Smart Lock, Smart health band, Smart bulb, Heart rate monitor, Smart Bottle and more.

The BLEMystique code and manuals will be released to general public. So, apart from using the pre-configured devices, the users can also add support for devices for their choice and use their ESP32 board for target practice. In this manner, this tool can improve the overall experience of learning BLE pentesting.
